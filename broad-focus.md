# Broad Focus - AIPM Framework

> **Context**: This document explores the expansive future vision for AIPM. For current implementation priorities, see `current-focus.md`. For architecture, see `AIPM.md`.

## The Grand Vision

AIPM evolves from a bash-based framework into a universal decision tracking infrastructure that seamlessly integrates with how modern teams actually work.

## Future Distribution Models

### NPM Package: `@aipm/core`
Transform the current bash scripts into a professional Node.js package:
- **CLI**: `npx aipm start` works anywhere
- **API**: Programmatic access to all AIPM operations
- **Plugins**: Extensible architecture for custom integrations
- **Cross-platform**: Native Windows support without WSL
- **Auto-updates**: Seamless version management

### AIPM as an MCP Server
Expose AIPM's functionality as Model Context Protocol tools:
```
aipm.workspace.list        # List available workspaces
aipm.session.start         # Start a session programmatically
aipm.memory.query          # Search through decision history
aipm.branch.analyze        # Understand branch relationships
aipm.decisions.timeline    # Visualize decision evolution
```

This allows ANY AI assistant to leverage AIPM's capabilities, not just through wrapper scripts.
