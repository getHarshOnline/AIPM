# stop.sh - AIPM Session Terminator (Thin Orchestration Layer)
#
# PURPOSE:
# --------
# Gracefully ends an AIPM session, saving work and cleaning up.
# This is a THIN WRAPPER that orchestrates existing module functions.
#
# ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES:
# -----------------------
# 1. NO BUSINESS LOGIC: All logic lives in modules, not here
# 2. ORCHESTRATION ONLY: We coordinate module function calls
# 3. RELATIONSHIP AWARE: stop = save + cleanup (calls save.sh)
# 4. WORKFLOW AWARE: Respects merge and push rules
# 5. USER FRIENDLY: Clear feedback about what's happening
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
# ---------------------
# - Gets current session information
# - Shows session duration
# - Saves uncommitted changes (via save.sh)
# - Merges session branch if configured
# - Pushes to remote if configured
# - Cleans up session state
# - Restores memory from backup
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO:
# -----------------------------
# - Direct git operations (delegates to version-control.sh)
# - Session state management (delegates to opinions-state.sh)
# - Memory manipulation (delegates to migrate-memories.sh)
# - Save logic (delegates to save.sh)
#
# USAGE EXAMPLES:
# --------------
# ./stop.sh                    # Stop current session
#
# CRITICAL LEARNINGS:
# ------------------
# 1. Session Info: get_session_info() provides ID:context:project
# 2. Stop = Save: Always offer to save before stopping
# 3. Session Branches: May need merging based on workflow
# 4. Memory Restore: Restore from backup after session ends
# 5. Manual Exit: User must exit Claude Code separately
#
# MAINTENANCE NOTES:
# -----------------
# - Keep this script under 80 lines (currently ~62)
# - This is the shortest wrapper - keep it that way
# - Test with dirty working directory
# - Verify session branch merge behavior
# - Check memory restoration works properly
#
# WHY IT'S DONE THIS WAY:
# ----------------------
# Previous version had 410 lines with:
# - Duplicate save logic (now calls save.sh)
# - Complex session detection
# - Manual memory operations
# - Hardcoded paths
# Now it's the cleanest wrapper - just orchestration.
#
# RELATIONSHIP TO save.sh:
# -----------------------
# stop.sh = save.sh + cleanup
# We literally call save.sh for the save part!
# This avoids duplication and maintains consistency.
#
# Dependencies: shell-formatting, version-control, migrate-memories, opinions-state
# Exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (error), uses die() for fatal errors
