# State Management Fix Plan - PENDING ITEMS ONLY

## Overview

Most of the state management implementation is COMPLETE. This document tracks ONLY the testing that remains.

## âœ… COMPLETED

- **Git violations**: All fixed (including revert.sh)
- **Documentation**: Functions are comprehensively documented
- **Bidirectional updates**: Implemented via report_git_operation()
- **Lock management**: Implemented
- **Atomic operations**: Implemented
- **State refresh**: Implemented

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy (PENDING)

### Lock Management Tests
Create tests for:
- Concurrent lock acquisition
- Lock timeout behavior  
- Lock cleanup on process exit
- Fallback mechanisms

### Atomic Operation Tests
Create tests for:
- Rollback on failure
- Nested atomic operations
- Concurrent atomic operations
- State consistency after rollback

### State Consistency Tests
Create tests for:
- Drift detection between git and state
- Repair mechanisms
- Validation functions
- Edge cases

### Integration Tests
Create tests for:
- Full workflow (init â†’ start â†’ save â†’ stop)
- Error scenarios
- Recovery mechanisms
- Performance benchmarks

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

1. **Test Coverage**: All critical paths tested
2. **Performance**: State operations < 100ms
3. **Reliability**: No race conditions or data loss
4. **Documentation**: Test suite documented

## ðŸ“… Estimated Timeline

- Create test framework: 2-3 hours
- Implement test suites: 4-6 hours
- Document test approach: 1 hour

**Total**: ~1 day of focused work
