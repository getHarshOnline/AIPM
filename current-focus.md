### ðŸ“š Documentation as We Build
Each script implementation should update:
1. **In-script comments** - Document why, not just what
2. **Implementation learnings** - Capture discoveries
3. **Design doc updates** - Refine architecture based on reality
4. **Test scenarios** - Document manual test cases

### ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy - version-control.sh Hardening

#### Branch Architecture for Safe Testing
```
main (safe checkpoint with base helper scripts)
  â”‚
  â””â”€> Framework_version_control (parallel feature branch, accumulates tested features)
        â”‚
        â””â”€> test_review (clean base for all test scenarios)
              â”‚
              â”œâ”€> test_merge_conflicts
              â”œâ”€> test_branch_pruning
              â”œâ”€> test_auto_stash
              â”œâ”€> test_undo_commit
              â”œâ”€> test_backup_branch
              â”œâ”€> test_cherry_pick
              â”œâ”€> test_rebase_scenarios
              â””â”€> test_[various scenarios]
```

#### Testing Approach
1. **Isolation Strategy**:
   - Framework_version_control runs parallel to main as testing ground
   - test_review provides clean starting point for all tests
   - Each test branch created from test_review (never from each other)
   - Successful tests selectively merged to Framework_version_control
   - Once all tests pass, Framework_version_control merges to main

2. **Checkpoint Commits**:
   - Framework_version_control: "docs: add version control testing strategy"
   - test_review: "test: define all test cases for version-control.sh"
   - Each provides a clean state for branching

3. **Test Categories**:
   - **Destructive Operations**: branch pruning, force push, reset
   - **Merge Scenarios**: conflicts, fast-forward, recursive
   - **Stash Operations**: auto-stash, stash conflicts, stash recovery
   - **History Rewriting**: rebase, cherry-pick, amend
   - **Backup/Recovery**: undo_last_commit, backup branches
   - **Edge Cases**: empty repos, detached HEAD, bare repos

4. **Success Criteria**:
   - Each function in version-control.sh tested in isolation
   - Integration with start/stop/save/revert scripts verified
   - Error handling validated for all failure modes
   - Performance under large repos tested
   - Cross-platform compatibility confirmed

## Memory Management Implementation

   - Implement interactive project selection with visual menus
2. Document each learning immediately
3. Test on real projects
4. Iterate based on usage patterns
5. Build tool ecosystem

## Helper Scripts Status

- **User experience first** - Interactive, colorful, helpful
- **Fail gracefully** - Clear errors with recovery hints
- **Platform aware** - Handle macOS/Linux differences
