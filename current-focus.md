### ðŸ“š Documentation as We Build
Each script implementation should update:
1. **In-script comments** - Document why, not just what
2. **Implementation learnings** - Capture discoveries
3. **Design doc updates** - Refine architecture based on reality
4. **Test scenarios** - Document manual test cases

### ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy - Component-Level Branch Architecture

#### CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: Component Testing Flow
```
main (stable baseline)
  â”‚
  â””â”€> Framework_version_control (feature branch accumulating ALL tested work)
        â”‚
        â””â”€> test_review (integration point for tested components)
              â”‚
              â”œâ”€> test_version_control_core (component: version-control.sh)
              â”‚     â”‚
              â”‚     â””â”€> test_version_control_hardening (isolated work)
              â”‚           â”‚ [harden the script]
              â”‚           â”‚ [test in isolation]

              â”‚           â””â”€> (merge back to core when ready)

              â”‚     â”‚
              â”‚     â””â”€> test_start_sh_implementation (isolated work)
              â”‚           â”‚ [implement features]
              â”‚           â”‚ [test thoroughly]
              â”‚           â””â”€> (merge back when tested)
              â”‚
              â”œâ”€> test_save_sh_core (component: save.sh)
              â”‚     â”‚
              â”‚     â””â”€> test_save_sh_golden_rule (isolated work)
              â”‚           â”‚ [implement golden rule]
              â”‚           â”‚ [test edge cases]
              â”‚           â””â”€> (merge back when proven)
              â”‚
              â””â”€> test_[component]_core
                    â”‚
                    â””â”€> test_[component]_[feature] (isolated work)
```

#### Component Testing Workflow
1. **Branch Creation Pattern**:
   - From `test_review`: Create `test_[component]_core` for each component
   - From core branch: Create `test_[component]_[feature]` for specific work
   - NEVER merge directly to test_review without going through core first

2. **Work Isolation**:
   - Each feature/hardening gets its own branch off the component core
   - Test exhaustively on the feature branch
   - Document all findings IN the feature branch
   - Only merge back to component core after review

3. **Integration Flow**:
   ```
   test_[component]_[feature] â†’ test_[component]_core â†’ test_review â†’ Framework_version_control â†’ main
   ```
   - Feature branches show granular work history
   - Core branches show component evolution
   - test_review shows integrated functionality
   - Framework_version_control shows complete feature set

4. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Each feature branch MUST have:
     - Test plan documentation
     - Test results
     - Issues found and fixes
     - Final audit report
   - Keeps complete history of what worked/didn't work

5. **Review Gates**:
   - Feature â†’ Core: Technical correctness review
   - Core â†’ test_review: Integration review
   - test_review â†’ Framework_version_control: Full functionality review
   - Framework_version_control â†’ main: Production readiness review

#### Current Testing Status
- **version-control.sh**:
  - `test_version_control_core`: Created âœ“
  - `test_version_control_hardening`: In progress (testing phase)
  - Next: Create test scripts, run tests, document results

#### Benefits of This Approach
1. **Complete History**: Every attempt, fix, and test is preserved
2. **Safe Testing**: Destructive tests never affect main work
3. **Clear Integration**: Each level shows different perspective
4. **Parallel Work**: Multiple components can be developed simultaneously
5. **Easy Rollback**: Can revert at any granularity level
