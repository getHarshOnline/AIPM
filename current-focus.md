#### Implementation Documentation
- [ ] Create AIPM_Design_Docs/implementation-learnings.md
  - [ ] Edge cases discovered
  - [ ] Platform-specific considerations
  - [ ] Performance optimizations
  - [ ] Security considerations
  - [ ] Team workflow patterns

### 📚 Documentation as We Build
Each script implementation should update:
1. **In-script comments** - Document why, not just what
2. **Implementation learnings** - Capture discoveries
3. **Design doc updates** - Refine architecture based on reality
4. **Test scenarios** - Document manual test cases

### 🧪 Testing Strategy - Component-Level Branch Architecture

#### CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: Component Testing Flow
```
main (stable baseline)
  │
  └─> Framework_version_control (feature branch accumulating ALL tested work)
        │
        └─> test_review (integration point for tested components)
              │
              ├─> test_version_control_core (component: version-control.sh)
              │     │
              │     └─> test_version_control_hardening (isolated work)
              │           │ [harden the script]
              │           │ [test in isolation]
              │           │ [document issues]
              │           └─> (merge back to core when ready)
              │
              ├─> test_start_sh_core (component: start.sh)
              │     │
              │     └─> test_start_sh_implementation (isolated work)
              │           │ [implement features]
              │           │ [test thoroughly]
              │           └─> (merge back when tested)
              │
              ├─> test_save_sh_core (component: save.sh)
              │     │
              │     └─> test_save_sh_golden_rule (isolated work)
              │           │ [implement golden rule]
              │           │ [test edge cases]
              │           └─> (merge back when proven)
              │
              └─> test_[component]_core
                    │
                    └─> test_[component]_[feature] (isolated work)
```

#### Component Testing Workflow
1. **Branch Creation Pattern**:
   - From `test_review`: Create `test_[component]_core` for each component
   - From core branch: Create `test_[component]_[feature]` for specific work
   - NEVER merge directly to test_review without going through core first

2. **Work Isolation**:
   - Each feature/hardening gets its own branch off the component core
   - Test exhaustively on the feature branch
   - Document all findings IN the feature branch
   - Only merge back to component core after review

3. **Integration Flow**:
   ```
   test_[component]_[feature] → test_[component]_core → test_review → Framework_version_control → main
   ```
   - Feature branches show granular work history
   - Core branches show component evolution
   - test_review shows integrated functionality
   - Framework_version_control shows complete feature set

4. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Each feature branch MUST have:
     - Test plan documentation
     - Test results
     - Issues found and fixes
     - Final audit report
   - Keeps complete history of what worked/didn't work

5. **Review Gates**:
   - Feature → Core: Technical correctness review
   - Core → test_review: Integration review
   - test_review → Framework_version_control: Full functionality review
   - Framework_version_control → main: Production readiness review

#### Current Testing Status
- **version-control.sh**:
  - `test_version_control_core`: Created ✓
  - `test_version_control_hardening`: COMPLETE ✓
  - **100% test coverage achieved** (all 41 functions tested)
  - Fixed environment detection bug
  - Added missing return statements
  - Documented test status inline for every function
  - Created comprehensive version-control.md documentation
  - Ready for wrapper script integration

- **Wrapper Scripts**:
  - Created `scripts/test/workflow.md` - Single source of truth ✓
  - Implementation guardrails established ✓
  - Basic implementations complete but need hardening
  - Created comprehensive hardening plan ✓
  - **NEXT**: Implement migrate-memories.sh module

- **Hardening Plan**:
  - Created `scripts/test/wrapper-scripts-hardening-plan.md` ✓
  - Identified all critical issues and edge cases
  - Designed migrate-memories.sh module architecture
  - Ready for hardening iterations

#### Benefits of This Approach
1. **Complete History**: Every attempt, fix, and test is preserved
2. **Safe Testing**: Destructive tests never affect main work
3. **Clear Integration**: Each level shows different perspective
4. **Parallel Work**: Multiple components can be developed simultaneously
5. **Easy Rollback**: Can revert at any granularity level
