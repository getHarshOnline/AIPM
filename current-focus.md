### ðŸ”§ Current Implementation Sprint

#### Session Management Scripts
- [ ] **start.sh** - Implement session initialization
  - [ ] Memory symlink verification (using hardened sync-memory.sh)
  - [ ] Interactive project selection menu
  - [ ] Git synchronization checks
  - [ ] Memory backup mechanism
  - [ ] Context-specific memory loading
  - [ ] Claude Code launch integration
  - [ ] Document learnings and edge cases

- [ ] **stop.sh** - Implement session cleanup
  - [ ] Active session detection
  - [ ] Integration with save.sh
  - [ ] Memory restoration from backup
  - [ ] Session artifact cleanup
  - [ ] Document session state handling

- [ ] **save.sh** - Implement memory persistence
  - [ ] Global to local memory transfer
  - [ ] Backup restoration logic
  - [ ] Git commit with statistics
  - [ ] Team collaboration support
  - [ ] Document memory flow patterns

- [ ] **revert.sh** - Implement version control
  - [ ] Active session safety checks
  - [ ] Interactive commit selection
  - [ ] Memory file reversion
  - [ ] Document git integration patterns

#### Implementation Documentation
- [ ] Create AIPM_Design_Docs/implementation-learnings.md
  - [ ] Edge cases discovered
  - [ ] Platform-specific considerations
  - [ ] Performance optimizations
  - [ ] Security considerations
  - [ ] Team workflow patterns

### ðŸ“š Documentation as We Build
Each script implementation should update:
1. **In-script comments** - Document why, not just what
2. **Implementation learnings** - Capture discoveries
3. **Design doc updates** - Refine architecture based on reality
4. **Test scenarios** - Document manual test cases

### ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy
- [ ] Create scripts/test/ directory
- [ ] Unit tests for each utility function
- [ ] Integration tests for full workflows
- [ ] Edge case documentation
- [ ] Platform compatibility checks (macOS, Linux)

## Memory Management Implementation

### Backup-Restore Isolation
- [x] Design complete with single backup location
- [x] Multi-project support architecture
- [ ] Implement backup/restore mechanism
- [ ] Test isolation between contexts
- [ ] Document memory migration patterns

### Team Collaboration
- [ ] Implement --sync-team flag
- [ ] Memory merge utilities
- [ ] Conflict resolution patterns
- [ ] Document team workflows

## Framework Tools Development

### Immediate Tools
- [ ] Memory statistics viewer
- [ ] Session history browser
- [ ] Project detector/lister
- [ ] Memory health checker

### Future Tools
- [ ] Memory visualization
- [ ] Protocol validator
- [ ] Project scaffolding
- [ ] Migration utilities

## Success Criteria
- âœ… All scripts have comprehensive error handling
- âœ… User-friendly interactive modes
- âœ… Clear documentation of learnings
- âœ… Platform compatibility
- âœ… Team collaboration support
- âœ… Performance optimization

## Next Steps
1. Start with start.sh implementation
   - Use shell-formatting.sh for all output
   - Use version-control.sh for git operations
   - Implement interactive project selection with visual menus
2. Document each learning immediately
3. Test on real projects
4. Iterate based on usage patterns
5. Build tool ecosystem

## Helper Scripts Status
- âœ… **shell-formatting.sh** - Complete, hardened, performance optimized
- âœ… **version-control.sh** - Complete with full formatting integration
- âœ… **sync-memory.sh** - Enhanced with visual feedback
- ðŸš§ **start.sh** - Ready for implementation
- ðŸš§ **stop.sh** - Ready for implementation
- ðŸš§ **save.sh** - Ready for implementation
- ðŸš§ **revert.sh** - Ready for implementation

## Implementation Philosophy
- **Document as we build** - Capture learnings immediately
- **Test early and often** - Manual testing before automation
- **User experience first** - Interactive, colorful, helpful
- **Fail gracefully** - Clear errors with recovery hints
- **Platform aware** - Handle macOS/Linux differences
